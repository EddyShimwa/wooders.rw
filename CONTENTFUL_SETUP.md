### Descriptions
- You can use **Rich Text** for descriptions (bold, italics, lists)
- The app will automatically convert Rich Text to plain text for display
- Keep product descriptions concise (2-3 sentences)

### Categories
- Create 5-10 categories to start
- Add 3-5 products per category minimum
- Use descriptive names that customers will recognize

### Products
- Always link products to a category using the **Category** reference field
- Set **Available** to `true` for products in stock
- Use clear, descriptive product names

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch categories" error
- Check that `CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID` and `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN` are set in `.env.local`
- Restart your dev server after changing environment variables
- Verify that you've published your content in Contentful (not just saved drafts)

### Categories showing but no products
- Make sure products are **linked** to categories via the Category reference field
- Check that products are published in Contentful
- Verify products have all required fields filled in

### Hero images not showing
- Make sure you've uploaded images to the **Images** field (array)
- Check that the hero entry is published
- Images should be in the **Images** array, not just the single **Image** field
